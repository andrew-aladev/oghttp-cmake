Please read "constants_processor" doc first.

Token processing should be available for single constant.
The most basic example is "GET" token for HTTP v0.9.

"constant" = "GET"

We can assign "0" state for empty string (initial state),
"1" for "G", "2" for "E", "3" for "T".
"max_state" will be "constant.length".

Constant itself can be represented as array of bytes in hexadecimal numeral system.
This representation is easy and won't provide conflicts with other code for any byte from constant.

"constant" = { 0x47, 0x45, 0x54 } // "GET"

We need to use "size_t" type to handle constant length, so type of processor state will be "size_t".
