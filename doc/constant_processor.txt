Please read "constants_processor" doc first.

Token processing should be available for single constant.
The most basic example is "GET" token for HTTP v0.9.

"constant" = "GET"

We can assign "0" state for empty string (initial state), "1" for "G", "2" for "E", "3" for "T".
"max_state" will be "constant.length".

Fast state type will be unified with other processors.
