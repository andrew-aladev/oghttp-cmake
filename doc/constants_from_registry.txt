Please read "constants_processor" doc first.

There are many constants connected with HTTP protocol.
Please visit registry website "https://www.iana.org/protocols".

Copy and paste these constants manually is a bad solution.
We will create generator that will create constants declaration automatically.

-----

Please look at the following xml files:
"https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xml"
"https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-warn-codes/http-warn-codes.xml"

We want to create constants declaration for status codes.

"http-status-codes.xml" includes main status codes.
We have to create custom xpath that will select "<value>" nodes without "<description>Unassigned</description>" sibling.

"http-warn-codes.xml" includes additional status codes.
We can use simple xpath that will select all "<value>" nodes.

Code duplicates should be ignored.

-----

Please look at the following xml file:
"https://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xml"

We want to create constants declaration for message headers.

This file consist of several registries.
User should be able to provide multiple xpathes for it.

-----

It is possible to make the following conclusion:
1. Constants can be placed into multiple xml files.
2. User should be able to declare custom xpath to find target node.
3. User should be able to provide multiple xpathes for each file.
4. Constant can be received by reading text content of target node.
5. Constant duplicates should be ignored.

We can provide the following example for HTTP status codes registry declaration:

<root>
  <file id="http-status-codes">
    <xpath>//registry[@id="http-status-codes-1"]//record/value[not(../description[text()="Unassigned"])]</xpath>
  </file>
  <file id="http-warn-codes">
    <xpath>//registry[@id="warn-codes"]//record/value</xpath>
  </file>
</root>

We can provide the following example for HTTP message headers registry declaration:

<root>
  <file id="message-headers">
    <xpath>//registry[@id="perm-headers"]//record/value</xpath>
    <xpath>//registry[@id="prov-headers"]//record/value</xpath>
  </file>
</root>
